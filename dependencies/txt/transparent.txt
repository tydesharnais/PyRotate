How a Transparent Proxy Works
-------------------------------------
Transparent proxies do not hide your IP Address and don’t alter any user information. They can help you browse the internet faster and get around some restrictions, or enforce restrictions. Your real IP address is sent in the X-Forwarded-For header. Your Via header is also sent, this shows the proxy software. The benefit of using a transparent proxy is obviously not in privacy but in that these proxies make it so websites load faster. This is because they cache content on websites you visit which speeds things up. The upstream bandwidth usage is reduced. Companies will use transparent proxies to keep their employees from being able to access specific websites, like social networks. A user could use a transparent proxy themselves to get past restrictions at work or school. They are also used for blocking local firewalls and downloading files from hosting services. The key thing to remember with transparent proxies is they aren’t much good if you are looking for anonymity while browsing the web.
