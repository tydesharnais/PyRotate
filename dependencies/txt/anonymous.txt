How an Anonymous Proxy Works
--------------------------------
An anonymous proxy does not reveal your IP address but does reveal that you are using a proxy server. So your IP address is not sent in the X-Forwarded-For header. Instead, this header is not forwarded or the IP address of the proxy is submitted in this space. The Via header is the same as with a transparent proxy, where it is shown that you are using a proxy server. This offers some level of privacy because even though they can see you are using a proxy, they don’t have your real IP. An anonymous proxy may still be blocked on a web page where someone really wants to restrict page access. In most cases, this won’t be an issue. Anonymous proxies can also perform caching like with transparent proxies to help speed up websites you’ve visited previously. Anonymous proxies are used by people who want some protection from things like hacking and also to have some confidentiality as they browse.
