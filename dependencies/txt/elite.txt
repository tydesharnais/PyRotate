How an Elite Proxy Works
------------------------------
Elite proxy servers hide both your IP address and the fact that you are using a proxy server at all. These are the most advanced proxies that offer the most security. The X-Forwarded-For and Via headers are not forwarded. This makes you look like you arenâ€™t using a proxy and are just a regular internet user. It only communicates the IP address of the proxy server. This would appear like if you were a casual browser using the internet regularly as well. The elite proxies will give you the most security, privacy, and protection as you browse the internet.
